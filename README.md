# Lemonade

Lemonade is a general purpose framework written in the `.less` preprocessor to be as stylish and extensible as possible.

To keep things simple, I am using the [Koala](http://koala-app.com/) app to compile the `.less` files. However, this will change so that the tools are more integrated with the project using node and npm.

Please come back soon for more information. If you are still curious, don't be afraid to poke around or message me at <zana200@icloud.com>.
