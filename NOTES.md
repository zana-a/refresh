# Notes

This project is structured into modules. Each folder has it's own master file named the same as the folder it resides in. For example:

```
.(root)
├── elements <- module
│   ├── _elements_.scss <- root module file
│   └── _buttons.scss <- any other files
└── lemonade.scss <- master file
```
